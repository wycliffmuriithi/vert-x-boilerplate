# vert-x-boilerplate
A backend project skeleton using vert-x and Java. 

The idea is to have a starter project that can:
 * connect to any database
 * initializa data
 * expose API
 * perform data validation on API request
 * do authentication using JWT
 * create a clustered starter
     
And of course many more as it continues to grow.
